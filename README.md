# project-surface
Project Surface was created as part of Innovation Days at Citrix.
It is a cheap touch surface using a front surfaced mirror, IR camera and IR edge illuminated plexiglass with OpenCV TUIO software.
Combined with an Arduino processing board to convert TUIO network packets to USB this can be plugged into a Windows 8 PC as a touch surface, with no special drivers required.
